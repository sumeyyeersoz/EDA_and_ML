In today’s competitive insurance industry, understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies are essential. The purpose of this report is to analyze HashSysTech Insurance data to determine the main features that affect customer conversions and consider our customer decision strategy.
Data visualization and machine learning modeling methods will help us to this purpose. In particular, it was aimed to determine important variables to optimize campaign strategies and use resources more efficiently. In light of these analyses, the report aims to reveal the necessary steps to improve future marketing campaigns.
Random Forest and Logistic Regression will be used in this analysis. Random Forest is well-suited for handling both categorical and numerical data, making it ideal for complex datasets where relationships between variables may not be linear (Breiman, 2001). Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is a simpler model that provides an interpretable way to understand how different factors impact customer decisions (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000). To achieve better results in model tuning methods will be applied.
In addition to the predictive power of these models, effective data preprocessing and feature engineering are critical to ensure that the models perform optimally. Data cleaning and transformation, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features, will be part of the analysis. 
Another essential aspect of this analysis will be model evaluation. By using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, we will assess the effectiveness of the models in predicting customer conversions. This process of model refinement is crucial for translating the model’s predictive power into actionable business insights.
In conclusion, the learning at the end of this analysis will definitely give enough scope to the company for targeting high-value customers, reducing costs, and enhancing conversion rates in successive campaigns.
